### Project Goals
The goal of this solo project was to build an app using React components to familiarize myself with the basic flow of a React app.

### Technologies/Paradigms Used
- JavaScript
- React.js
- HTML/JSX
- CSS

### Challenges
- Learning a new framework has been both challenging and extremely rewarding. Up until now I have only had experience with Object Oriented Programming in Vanilla Javascript. I'm very excited to dive deeper into React and explore the incredible advantages it has over Vanilla JS!

### Future Additions
- Search functionality
- More thoughtful UI
- Use of the fetch API

### Setup
- Clone down the repo 
- Change into the project directory in your command line
- Install NPM with `npm install`
- Run `npm start`
